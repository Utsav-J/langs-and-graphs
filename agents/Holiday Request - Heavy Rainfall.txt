Subject: Holiday Request - Heavy Rainfall

Dear College Dean,

I am writing to request a holiday on [Date] due to the heavy rainfall and potential flooding in my area. The weather conditions are making it difficult and unsafe for me to commute to college, which could lead to missed classes and assignments.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will ensure all my urgent academic tasks are completed before my leave. I will be available remotely if needed for any urgent college matters.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Utsav
